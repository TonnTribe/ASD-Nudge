## Description

We are created an application to create tasks and routines for people on the Autism Spectrum. 
It will provide schedules with everyday routines and tasks with images showing what the task is. 
It will provide rewards for finishing tasks. 

The idea behind this application came from personal experience with ASD. 
Two of our team members have a child on the spectrum.  Dealing with conflicts and establishing 
a routine can help a person with ASD. The need for a routine can provide structure and stability, which in turn, will help them become focused on 
finishing tasks without issues or problems.

Someone with ASD needs help with establishing a routine. This app will help them become 
more structured and focused on finishing tasks without issues or problems. The parents or 
caregiver can create a schedule to help with everyday tasks like hygiene to finishing homework 
or timing out each task.
